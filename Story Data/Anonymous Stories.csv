J.J. Collett Natural Area,"I grew up going to this park, it's one of my favourites and I visit each time I go home to visit my family, around 5-10 times per year. Growing up in the area, I was a member of Brownies in Ponoka for several years, and this is where our group went to learn orienteering, animal tracking, and tree and plant identification.
This is also where my grandparents would take us grandkids to learn an appreciation of the outdoors and the value of exploring our local natural areas. 
Years later, this is where I bring my partner for hiking and picnicking and it's a place that has become very meaningful for both of us.   
","memorable, beautiful, relaxing",
Cataract Creek Provincial Recreation Area,I love this campground. It is close to Calgary and easy to get to. I have camped in tents and done the adjacent hikes (Mount Burke and Raspberry Ridge). Other people there were great and the campground manager was very friendly and helpful when I needed help determining how to pay and purchasing fire wood.,"accessible, hiking, fishing",
Highwood Provincial Recreation Area,I learned to identify a large number of Alpine flora here.  The diversity of species in such an easily accessible space is irreplaceable.,"quiet, colourful, inspiring.",
Park Lake Provincial Park,"My son took multiple lauding courses on Park Lake through a small, local business. He also got to do a course with his Dad that was a Father's Day present. 
A few years later he taught me kayak safety and how to paddle when we ended up unexpectedly kayaking on the skeleton ocean. The first of the lessons is priceless. But only is he safe (and those with him) on the water, but he had new ways to explore Alberta. Park Lake is a perfect place to learn the basics- calm, close to the city, and much of the year clean enough to swim in. ","community, learning, life experience",These paths should remain open. Not only after they a part of our heritage but they provide lifelong learning opportunities.
Sibbald Lake Provincial Recreation Area,I love this area and the campgrounds around it.  The little lake is a perfect tiny watering hole for swimming.  The wildflowers around here are amazing.  And it's such a quiet area.,"quiet, flowers, swimming",
Indian Graves Provincial Recreation Area,I hiked around here with the University of Calgary Outdoor club years ago.  Beautiful area.,"beautiful, hiking, quiet",
Chin Coulee Provincial Recreation Area,"Chin Coulee is a common waterhole for various activities for the residents which live in the area. I have memories going there with my family when I was young, with friends as a teenager and now to take photos of the stars and the sunset. It holds good memories of flying of tubes. Clinging to the bridge as a semi drives by and catching my first fish by myself. ","boating, fishing, swimming",
Park Lake Provincial Park,"Park lake has been a part of my life for the last 6+ years. Me and my husband used to take our dogs swimming out there off the boat launch when it was just the 2 of us. Once we had our first child we have made so many memories playing on the beach and swimming out there. Since we've had a second child I'd love for her to have the same memories. It is a place we make memories, as a family. We meet our extended family there and friends. It is a place we love, please don't take it away from us.","beautiful, memories, fun",
Cow Lake Natural Area,"Cow Lake is a place that my family does a yearly campout at. I have great memories of last year when my mother, niece and nephew camped there for a couple of days. I really like the area and the campground itself. It's affordable and accessible.","fun, affordable, maintained",I don't want this government to sell us out on these campgrounds
Bleriot Ferry Provincial Recreation Area,Discovered this gem last year after my friends mother passed away suddenly. We were looking for somewhere in the badlands to get away for a night and stubble across Bleriot Ferry. We spent one night there in the shadow of the Coulee's and a stones throw away from the Red Deer River. It was a great place to help him collect his thoughts and just be. We climbed to the top of the coulee's that night to watch the sunset and the whole experience really helped my friend develop some peace to deal with his moms passing.,"peaceful, beautiful, accessible ",
Lundbreck Falls Provincial Recreation Area,Lots of local kids would have birthday parties at the Falls in summertime.  My grandma used to tell me stories about the dances they used to have there and the paths she used to walk to get there.,"exciting, happy, childhood","Good luck, OP.  I don't live in AB but was going to take my daughter to this specific place when we are in the province.  It breaks my heart to see it taken away from us like this."
Park Lake Provincial Park,I've been swimming and canoeing at park lake since I was a small kid 5/6 years old. (I'm almost 40) and have been keeping the tradition going with my kids. We Always camp at Park lake as that's what my youngest wants for his birthday.  So many of us use this lake and campground. Please dont take it away. We need it. ( human populess) ,"memories, fun, relaxation ",
Cataract Creek Provincial Recreation Area,"This area is beautiful for biking in spring before the highway opens. I would frequently bike down the highway until I found an area with a spot that looked nice to hike. The bike in itself never gets old - the views are unparalleled and the hikes give you even greater views. On one occasion, I ended up on top of a ridge near here on a cloudy day, only to start hearing a strange buzzing noise. It turned out to be my watch, which was vibrating due to all the static in the air! Keep in mind we'd hiked probably 5 hours up at this point. My partner and I high-tailed it off the ridge immediately, for fear of a lightning strike, and that has got to be the most stressful experience I've had on a ridge. On the way down, we had to duck into a band of trees as it started hailing. Fortunately it didn't last long and we were able to finish (running) making our way down the mountain. The down trek only took 2 hours! Always makes for a good story though","electric, weather, hike",
Mesa Butte Provincial Recreation Area,"When my partner and I first visited the province of Alberta from our home in Ontario we decided to visit Mesa Butte and go hiking. It was on these trails that we were stunned by the shear beauty of this province, the foothills, the Rockies and we made the decision to uproot our lives and make the move to Alberta. We've now lived here for almost 3 years and my heart would break if I knew that, not only would this place be delisted/closed, but that the land may be open to development/sale. ","magical, restorative, grounding",
Dry Island Buffalo Jump Provincial Park - Tolman Bridge Campgrounds,"I take my nieces and nephews to Henry's Shoes (Trochu, great shoe store!) for their grade one shoes and we go to Dry Island Buffalo Jump to spend the afternoon. This is a unique area and they (and I) love the terrain and river. ","awe-inspiring, exciting, engaging",
Dry Island Buffalo Jump Provincial Park - Tolman Bridge Campgrounds,This is a very popular little campground for families. Kids love to wade in the Red Deer river and play along the shoreline. There is a rope swing hanging off the bridge is is very popular with older kids. An excellent put in spot/take out spot for kayakers and canoeists. Also and great place to camp for overnight river trips on the Red Dee River. ,"quiet, family orientated, popular",All best in your research. 
Riverlot 56 Natural Area,"I would take my old dog to Riverlot 56 all of the time. On her last day alive I took her there so she could enjoy the smells one last time. It holds such a special place in my heart, and I would be devastated if I could never go there again.","peaceful,  fondness, beautiful ",
Chain Lakes Provincial Recreation Area,"I have been going to Chain Lakes since a young child. My father would take me fishing, while my mother watched. Now, 30 years later, I watched my 5 year old son catch his first fish with his grandfather. What my father doesn't know is that he's not very good at fishing... catching fish rarely happens with him! My son's fish was caught after he wandered to a man fishing nearby who has several fish in a bucket. My son asked him what he was using and then asked to be given a cast with the lure he was using. My son cast by my father and before I could blink, he was relying in a lovely trout!","peaceful, beautiful, restorative ",We need nature to live 
Prairie Creek Provincial Recreation Area,My inlaws camped there when my husband was little and we continued the tradition going 3 or more times per year. Stall 6 is our favorite. There are three spruce trees in a clump next to the site that we have watched grow from a foot or two tall to well over 15 feet. We call them the three sisters. ,"peaceful, rejuvenating, joyful","The campground has become very busy. The last couple of years, the two main loops have been almost full on weekends. The third loop is basically closed already. It would also be devastating if it were opened to ATVs. Also a week ago, we drove out to Preachers Point on Abraham Lake. It's taken care of by users and has become a potholed gravel parking lot. My husband said, ""welcome to the future of Alberta Parks."" I almost cried. "
Waterton Reservoir Provincial Recreation Area,"i went hiking with my family and after the niki we went to town to look around and eat, once we started we realized it was so small and there weren't any asian places to eat i was disappointed. i mean aside from hiking, going on a boat or eating there isn't anything to do. i wish there would be a water park and more diverse restaurants","spacious, lakes, small",
Park Lake Provincial Park,Great place for family summer fun!,"pleasant, fun, memorable ",
