My father would take me fishing, while my mother watched. Now, 30 years later, I watched my 5 year old son catch his first fish with his grandfather. What my father doesn't know is that he's not very good at fishing... catching fish rarely happens with him! My son's fish was caught after he wandered to a man fishing nearby who has several fish in a bucket. My son asked him what he was using and then asked to be given a cast with the lure he was using. My son cast by my father and before I could blink, he was relying in a lovely trout!", "Words that describe the park": "peaceful, beautiful, restorative, unique, rare, special", "Additional Stories": "I had a cabin at Island Lake and we would often go to Chain Lakes in the summer for fishing (no boats allowed); the fall for the deer and blueberry picking and in the winter to skidoo through the lakes. The stars were so visible. We often came across campers in all seasons. One winter it was a couple living in a tent with a stove for warmth. It was lovely. We saw a beautiful owl and on our way back we saw about 15 cows running across the road and jumping a fence. There were ospreys and herons. It left a lasting impression which I think about often.

We were looking for somewhere in the badlands to get away for a night and stubble across Bleriot Ferry. We spent one night there in the shadow of the Coulee's and a stones throw away from the Red Deer River. It was a great place to help him collect his thoughts and just be. We climbed to the top of the coulee's that night to watch the sunset and the whole experience really helped my friend develop some peace to deal with his moms passing.", "Words that describe the park": "peaceful, beautiful, accessible, family, history, connection, unique, memorable, enticing, wonderful, wild, youth, friendly operator", "Additional Stories": "-- I proposed to my wife here after crossing the ferry and cycling up the canyon on the other side. It's a spot that is very important to us.    -- My grandfather ran this ferry. My father, and our entire family, have an indescribable emotional connection to this entire  area. The thought of it not being cared for is incredibly upsetting. Let me know how I can help.    --  We _just_ discovered this park last month on our way home from Drumheller. We're in our 50's. I always loved camping but my partner has resisted his whole life. Finally gave it a go this summer since there were few other options, and loved it! The ferry ride was such a highlight! We were especially moved by the Bleriot history since we are originally from Quebec and French Canadian. This was going to be our destination for next year!    -- We chose this beautiful, quiet place for our first camping trip with our infant daughter on Easter weekend, 1999.  I remember breaking sticks for the campfire and she thought that was hilarious.  We returned many times while she was growing up, often with friends.  I'd like to go back again. It makes me very sad and angry that this campground is being taken away from us by a very short-sighted and mean-spirited government.      --I really enjoyed taking the Bleriot Ferry with the family the fall of 2018. The ferry operator was very friendly and had many lovely stories to share during the short ferry ride in this beautiful area. I really hope the ferry will continue to operate in the future and that the beautiful surrounding will be protected from environmental disturbance.      --As a teenager (14 to 16) in Drumheller, from 1971 - 1973 we would tent camp along the southwest side,  downstream of the Bleriot Ferry on long weekends: Victoria Day, Canada Day, Heritage Day. It would often be packed, sometimes 3-400 people along that side, many families from Calgary. As teenage boys will do, we would try to introduce ourselves to teenage girls from Calgary. We partook in many other activities as well -- not all so suitable for your stories. Some of our cohort had Yamaha 125 dirt bikes -- always quite terrifying to ride behind someone else; one year, someone brought their pellet gun -- also somewhat terrifying, however a crack shot he was. Camping was quite different then with no electricity. More tent trailors and tents than motor homes.  It was a beautiful place to camp in the shadow of Cotton Woods along the Red Deer River." }, "geometry": { "type": "MultiPolygon", "coordinates": [ [ [ [ 646324.358499999973, 5712700.137099999934 ], [ 646461.706399999558926, 5712704.852499999106 ], [ 646458.03000000026077, 5712658.848399999551 ], [ 646436.362399999984, 5712579.65 ], [ 646422.915099999867, 5712502.36959999986 ], [ 646330.012000000104308, 5712499.1731 ], [ 646324.358499999973, 5712700.137099999934 ] ] ] ] } },

I would frequently bike down the highway until I found an area with a spot that looked nice to hike. The bike in itself never gets old - the views are unparalleled and the hikes give you even greater views. On one occasion, I ended up on top of a ridge near here on a cloudy day, only to start hearing a strange buzzing noise. It turned out to be my watch, which was vibrating due to all the static in the air! Keep in mind we'd hiked probably 5 hours up at this point. My partner and I high-tailed it off the ridge immediately, for fear of a lightning strike, and that has got to be the most stressful experience I've had on a ridge. On the way down, we had to duck into a band of trees as it started hailing. Fortunately it didn't last long and we were able to finish (running) making our way down the mountain. The down trek only took 2 hours! Always makes for a good story though", "Words that describe the park": "electric, weather, hike, accessible, hiking, fishing", "Additional Stories": "I love this campground. It is close to Calgary and easy to get to. I have camped in tents and done the adjacent hikes (Mount Burke and Raspberry Ridge).

The place is so diverse: sandy portions, wetlands, wild flowers, poplar and climax spuce -- whole forest succession. A beautiful Parkland Ecotone. Helen could spot and identify a Harebell , a Lady Slipper, Shooting Stars or a Northern Starflower from 35 metres. Her knowledge was astonishing.  And of course if you visited J.J. Collett two weeks later in mid June (that year) there woudl be all kinds of new wildflowers in bloom through the late spring. One person with us, Eileen Ford, decided we needed to tap this increcible knowlege and started a Flower Focus Groupl  Eileen was so inspired to she took course at Vermillion so she could learn the Latin and went on to lead many outings all over Alberta inspired by Helen Harris. Helen received first Owl Award that RDRN presents to a dedicated member each year in 1999.  Such a diverse, beautiful place.

", "Words that describe the park": "awe-inspiring, exciting, engaging, quiet, family orientated, popular, historic, special, beautiful, unique, magnificent, stunning, breathtaking, fascinating, ecotone, relief, peaceful, specatular, energizing", "Additional Stories": "-- This is a very popular little campground for families. Kids love to wade in the Red Deer river and play along the shoreline. There is a rope swing hanging off the bridge is is very popular with older kids. An excellent put in spot\/take out spot for kayakers and canoeists. Also and great place to camp for overnight river trips on the Red Dee River.     -- The first time I saw it, I thought wow, would I love to take a canoe down the river here.  Years later, I paddled it and it was everything I imagined it to be: a beautiful, historic, special place.  I hope this park is saved so that others can enjoy it, too.    -- Every summer I take my nieces and nephews on adventures. Because there are seven of them, various ages, I double them up and give them a chance to spend time with their cousins, rather than their siblings. For the past few years, one of the most requested adventures is to go to \"the place with the river and the mountains\". This is Dry Island Buffalo Jump (\"mountains\" to kids!). We go, play in the river, have a picnic, and explore the park. The kids love it and talk about it all year. This park is less than an hour from where we live and gives us the chance to have a little holiday locally, without spending a lot of money. The topography and history fascinates these children (and me!) and it will break my heart to tell them that we can not go to \"the place with the river and the mountains\". This place of history and memories should be available to all.      --I had a large dog who only ever stood in the river not a swimmer, he had long hair and on a very hot day early in July we were in the river with our dog when suddenly he began yipping and kind of hopping, very distressed. I waded over to him....he was surrounded by dozens of baby garter snakes jumping up at the water droplets on his long hairs...was the most crazy wonderful thing i had ever seen. Did not know that these snakes swam was sooo kool! However my big big dog was very traumatized as i hailed him back to shore. Love this place.      --In 1994 as Preisdent of the Red Deer River Naturalists we met a group from the Federation of Alberta Naturalists (FAN) then, now Nature Alberta.  I forget her name but there was a lady who lived nearby and was a wealth of local ecological knowledge who met us.  It was a scorcher of a day, at least 30 degrees in early July.  Some of the group headed for the Buffalo Jump some to the Dry Island. I was with the Buffalo Jump group. We were out there at least 4 hours, half way down from the first plateau at 2:30 pm when a lady from Edmonton, a tall angular, in shape, in her mid 70s sprained her ankle. We were in trouble. We would have to carry her back up the hill and back where we started.  As we were deciding what the heck to do a couple of people came by in a canoe. They were drinking and their cell phone was dead.  Fortunately, the University of Calgary Canoe Club were out practicing.  We could then carry her down the hill and one of the canoes took her back upstream where we started. Otherwise, we were really in a bind.     --I have been a regular hiker at Dry Island Buffalo Jump since 1991. I think it is the most spectacular place to hike within an hour's drive of Red Deer. I love this place. On top of the dry island is one of the few places you can find that is completely devoid of mechanical noises. Occasionally I hear a small plane far off in the distance, but because it is so far away and faint, it doesn't feel like an intrusion. I look forward to them fixing the road, as hiking down to the picnic area and back up to the parking lot adds a lot of time to a pleasant hike." }, "geometry": { "type": "MultiPolygon", "coordinates":
